# Integrate Hyrax 2 with OCFL

DPS is the Digital Preservation Service, by the Oxford University Research Archives ([ORA](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/)) team. 

The aim of this project is to store copies of all significant versions of ORA objects in an OCFL storage root, using Fedora 6 as an API layer for managing  the OCFL store.
